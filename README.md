# <h1>Rock-Paper-Scissor Game</h1>

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a total of five rounds, with the final winner determined based on the number of wins.

# How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissor` when prompted.

   • Rock beats Scissors<br>
   • Scissors beats Paper<br>
   • Paper beats Rock
   • If both choose the same, it's a draw.
   
5. The game continues for 5 rounds.
6. After 5 rounds, the final score is displayed, and the overall winner is determined.
